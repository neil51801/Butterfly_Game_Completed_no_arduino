What up team TYNK

in the TYNK file I got all the code to run the game without arduino
I have all the downloadable png files and mp3 sound flies that the code pulls

In the code your gonna have to change the file loaction for all of these, just use chatgpt to copy your file loaction where everything dowloaded and tell it to replace/ update the file loaction to what yours is

sadly I think you need to dowload what I did to run the code, below i will tell you how to get it and check if it is installed
First we need "pip", pip installs all the further functions into python
Checking if Pip is Installed, Open a command prompt, and run the below code

pip --version

Installing Pip (windows), go to https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
Open a command prompt and use the following code

python get-pip.py

For macOS and Linux
Open a terminal, and copy the below (one of them should work)

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo yum install python3-pip

please recheck if pip is installed, (use "pip --version")

Installing Pygame
copy the below code into cmd window

pip install pygame

Checking if it is installed,

pip show pygame
